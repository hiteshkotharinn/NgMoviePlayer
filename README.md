# NgMoviePlayer

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## How it works
Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. We use Yarn to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. you can install it from Here, then run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
